Final Result:

All monitored parameters are within healthy ranges.
No signs of instability, memory exhaustion, or weak connectivity.
Temperature metric is missing; this limits the completeness of the assessment.
Recommendations:

No immediate actions required—device is operating optimally.
Enable and monitor temperature telemetry for full-spectrum health diagnostics.
Continue to track heap memory and RSSI for early detection of potential issues.
Regularly verify for unexpected resets or firmware updates.
Summary:
Your ESP32 device is functioning well, with strong wireless connectivity and plenty of free memory. There are no warnings or critical issues found in the latest data. For a more comprehensive health evaluation, please ensure temperature data is included in future reports. At present, no intervention is necessar
